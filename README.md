# SAPER

My game design is based on the iconic Minesweeper game written in 1981 by Robert Donner. In my version, I updated the game with new sounds and graphics. I also added four 
difficulty levels. The game dynamically generates the size of the game board and the corresponding game table, depending on the selected difficulty level. My project is written and optimized for the Linux operating system.


## Description of the modules
The program was created from four modules. The Config.py module contains all the global variables needed for the correct operation of the entire program. It consists of objects that need global access, flags, a dictionary with the names of graphic files and global integers. Function.py is the whole brain of the program, it contains the most important functions. It determines what is hidden under the clicked button, generates the entire game_table, which is later responsible for where the bombs and fields with numbers are located. Game_table is a generated 2-D list with only zeros at first, then the required number of mines is randomly generated on this table. For list items that are not generated mines, adjacent item coordinates are searched. Then it is checked how many of the found elements are bombs. In the last step, the number of adjacent bombs is is overwritten for zero, and so on for each element that is not a bomb. The function in the module recurses to display empty fields and fields adjacent to bombs. Modul is responsible for sounds and graphic files. This module determines when a win or loss occurs and what happens in those cases. In this file, global variables change their values and objects that are no longer needed are destroyed for better program operation and better memory management. GUI.py is responsible for creating the main application window and initializing the application screens: start_label and game_label. In start_label we choose the difficulty level, after selecting the difficulty level, the game_label is initialized with the parameters and global variables selected for it. In the game_label there is a function responsible for initializing the game_board and calling the game_table function. In the game_label the clock and mines counter update function is called for the first time. Main.py is the module that executes the program. It calls the main application window creation functions, initializes the sound mixer object, loads the names of the needed images into a global variable, and initializes the start_label for the root object. Finally, the main loop method of the program is executed on the root object, thanks to this method, the program does not terminate and runs in a loop.
